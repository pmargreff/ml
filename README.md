# Machine Learn in Julia
Machine Learning algorithms

## Synopsis

This repository contains the main algorithms studied in Machine Learning class, most of them are only to study the purpose and not are optimized enough to be used day-by-day. But if you want to learn the simple math in the process, or learn how Julia can handle with that, feel free to look closely.

## Installation

All algorithms built on [Julia](http://julialang.org/) programming language, so you will need instal Julia and the follow packages:
- Dataframes
- TextAnalysis

## Reference

Each algorithm is in her own directory, with the respective tests. In the algorithm directory you will find the README file with instructions to run each one, and the correct file format too. 

## TODO:
 - Neural Network
